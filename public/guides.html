				<h2 class="guide-title">Track Creation</h2>

				<img class="guide-image" src="/resources/TrackCreation-page.png" />
				<p class="guide-paragraph">
					The MotoLogger application allows you to create custom tracks anywhere
					in the world. To create a new track, open the tracks page from the
					MotoLogger Dashboard screen. Once the tracks page is open, tap on the
					add button at the bottom right of the screen and follow the displayed
					prompt. After entering a track name, MotoLogger will display a track
					creation screen where you can begin to define your track on a map.
					There are two important aspects to tracks in MotoLogger: finish lines
					and timing gates. Each track created in MotoLogger must have a single
					finish line. Timing gates are used to define specific sectors on the
					track that you would like to time when recording a session. Each track
					in MotoLogger can contain as many timing gates as you would like to
					add. To place a finish line, tap on the add icon at the bottom right
					of the track creation screen. A sub-menu will be shown with two
					buttons. The button containing the flag icon is used to add a finish
					line and the button containing the stopwatch icon is used to add
					timing gates. The method of drawing finish lines and timing gates are
					identical, simply tap on one of the sub-menu buttons and use your
					finger to draw a line on the screen to represent your finish line /
					timing gate. To delete a finish line or timing gate, simply tap on the
					respective finish line / timing gate and select delete on the
					resulting pop-up dialog box.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="guide">
				<h2 class="guide-title">Track Editing</h2>
				<p class="guide-paragraph">
					You may edit an existing track in MotoLogger by placing a new finish
					line or removing / adding new timing gates. To accomplish this, open
					the tracks page from the MotoLogger dashboard screen. Once the tracks
					page is open, tap on the track you wish edit to open the track editing
					screen. From the track editing screen, you may delete existing finish
					lines / timing gates and replace them with new ones. After you have
					finished editing the track, tap the save icon at the top right of the
					track editing screen to save your changes. Note: if you attempt to
					save an edited track without a finish line, your track will not be
					saved.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="guide">
				<h2 class="guide-title">Recording an Internal Session</h2>
				<img class="guide-image-landscape" src="/resources/LapTimer-page.png" />
				<p class="guide-paragraph">
					MotoLogger can utilize your mobile device’s internal GPS to record
					sessions. To begin recording a session with your device’s internal
					GPS, open the race page from the MotoLogger dashboard screen. Next,
					select the track you wish to record a session on and enter a name for
					the session. After you have completed the preliminary setup for the
					session, MotoLogger will display the lap timer screen. On this screen,
					you will find an elapsed time display, last lap time counter, lap
					counter, fastest lap time, and a satellite icon. You may notice that
					the satellite icon blinks when you first begin recording an internal
					GPS session. This indicates that your mobile device is attempting to
					acquire satellite signal. Once the satellite icon stops blinking, your
					device has acquired satellite connection and you may begin your
					session. Upon crossing the finish line for the first time, your
					session will begin, and the elapsed timer will start. Note: for more
					accurate lap times and visual lap lines, ensure you place your mobile
					device in a position that has a clear unobstructed view of the sky.
					Note: this feature is battery intensive and will drain your battery
					charge at a faster than normal rate.
				</p>

			<div class="guide">
				<h2 class="guide-title">Recording an External Session</h2>
				<p class="guide-paragraph">
					MotoLogger can utilize the Dual XGPS160 device to record sessions. To
					begin recording a session with your XGPS160, power on your device and
					wait for the green light to stop blinking indicating that the device
					has acquired GPS signal. Once GPS signal is acquired, double tap the
					power button to begin recording your session. After you are finished
					recording your session, you can stop recording on the device by double
					tapping the power button. To import your recorded session to the
					MotoLogger application for analyzation, open the Sessions page from
					the Dashboard menu. Before proceeding with the next steps, ensure your
					XGPS160 is powered on and actively searching for a Bluetooth signal
					(this is indicated by a blinking blue light). Next, tap on the add
					icon in the bottom right of the Sessions page. Follow along with the
					prompts of the MotoLogger application to upload your recorded session
					to the app.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="guide">
				<h2 class="guide-title">MotoLogger Analyzation Algorithm</h2>
				<p class="guide-paragraph">
					It is important to understand how MotoLogger analyzes your lap times
					to ensure you can successfully record your sessions. When analyzing
					your data, MotoLogger will search for the first lap you completed
					while crossing every timing gate and the finish line defined on the
					selected track. Once this lap is found, MotoLogger will use the
					ordering in which you crossed the timing gates on this lap to analyze
					the rest of your laps. Now, if you cross the finish line but skip one
					or more timing gates on the track, then that lap will not count until
					you have crossed the missed timing gate(s) and any timing gates
					following the missed timing gates in the correct ordering determined
					by lap time analyzation algorithm.
				</p>

			<div class="guide">
				<h2 class="guide-title">Creating Bikes and Setups</h2>
				<p class="guide-paragraph">
					MotoLogger can track various aspects of your bike, from bike
					maintenance to setups. To create a new bike, open the Garage page by
					tapping the garage button on the Dashboard menu. Once open, tap on the
					add icon at the bottom right of the screen and fill out the required
					items for your bike. To create a new setup for a bike, select a bike
					from the garage page. Then swipe left to the setups page. You can add
					a new setup by tapping on the add icon at the bottom right of the
					screen.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="guide">
				<h2 class="guide-title">Tracking Bike Data</h2>
				<img class="guide-image" src="/resources/Garage-page.png" />
				<p class="guide-paragraph">
					MotoLogger allows you to track the number of laps completed, distance
					traveled, and time logged on a specified bike. If you wish to track
					this information each time a session is recorded for a specific bike,
					you must set the bike as your default bike. To set a bike as your
					default bike, open the garage page from the MotoLogger dashboard menu.
					Once open, long tap on the bike you wish to set as default until
					MotoLogger displays a pop dialog showing the bike options. Then,
					select the “Set as default” option. You will then see a green check
					mark on the bike list item that you set as default.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="guide">
				<h2 class="guide-title">Tracking Setup Data</h2>
				<img class="guide-image" src="/resources/Setups-page.png" />
				<p class="guide-paragraph">
					MotoLogger allows you to track and view sessions recorded under a
					specific setup. To track sessions under a specific setup you must
					first set the bike corresponding to the setup you wish to track
					sessions under as your default bike. Next, open your default bike and
					swipe left until you see your list of setups. Then, long tap on the
					setup you wish to set as default to open the setup options dialog box.
					Once the dialog box is opened, select the “Set as default” option.
					Once you have set a setup as default, you will see a green checkmark
					on the setup list item. To view sessions recorded under a setup,
					simply click on the setup and swipe left to view a list of recorded
					sessions.
